They will gain experience in solving physics problems with tools such as graphical analysis, algebra, vector analysis, and calculus.  The course follows the typical progression of topics of a first-semester university physics course:  Kinematics, Newton’s Laws, Energy, and Momentum.\n\nThis course serves as an introduction to the physics of force and motion.
